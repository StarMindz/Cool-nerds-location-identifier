# Cool-nerds-location-identifier
A model built by fine tuning BERT transformer model for location mention recognition.
> Description the project.
This model was built using a BERT pre-trained model. It can identify location mentions in sentences/tweets
The dataset used for training this model is the IDRISI dataset. It contains 19 disaster events with a total of 20,514 annotated tweets. Detailed statistics and the dataset are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rsuwaileh/IDRISI)

## Built With

- Pytorch 
- Transformers 
- On python 

## Getting Started
